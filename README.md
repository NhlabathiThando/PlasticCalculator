# PlasticCalculator
A fun and fabulous Mean Girls-themed calculator built with JavaFX!
Every button press comes with sass, style, and iconic quotes from the Plastics.
Perfect for anyone who believes "the limit does not exist!" ðŸ’–

Features
Basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

Special buttons:

Fetch: Multiplies the current number by 1.5 (because fetch is extra!)

Limit: Squares the current number (because, again, the limit does not exist!)

Clear (C) and Backspace (âŒ«) buttons for easy correction

Displays random Mean Girls quotes throughout your calculations

Stylish pink-themed user interface with hotpink accents

Handles division by zero gracefully with a sassy message

Error handling for invalid input
